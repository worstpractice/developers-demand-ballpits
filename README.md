# developers-demand-ballpits

A fun and interesting programming challenge solved in TypeScript.

## Where do I look?

The meat and potatoes of this thing is located in the `challengeSolution.ts` file.

## And where can I find the discussion?

Wherever you find the code, in fact. I decided to socratically sprinkle the discussion across the various parts of the source code.

I'm a huge fan of the conversational writing style of esteemed programming communicators like [Amos](https://fasterthanli.me/series/reading-files-the-hard-way/part-1) and [Eli Bendersky](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/launching-linux-threads-and-processes-with-clone/) (to name just two).

I will clarify however that normal code should never be documented like this. It isn't really documentation, per se.

Nor is it meant to be. Just like this exercise isn't an example of normal coding, either.

On the contrary, the exercise fills a purpose all its own â€” as does the text.

## Speaking of which, where is the part on testing?

In a nutshell, if I was stranded on a desert island and could only pick one way to test a project like this (imagining the bigger API that this challenge references in its description), I would probably pick E2E testing and then begin arranging coconuts on the beach to spell out H-E-L-P in huge letters.

If we test E2E and every aspect of the product reachable from it (the perspective of the users) simply work, that pretty much has to mean the operative parts of the backend, frontend, integration, design, and network (among others) works. That is a pretty airtight definition of "works".

On a smaller scale, for code of the kind written here though, I would probably say property-based testing. Property based testing is amazingly well adapted for code of this nature, where we have a range of inputs and we essentially want to fuzz all aspects of the implementation, and especially find minimal reproducible edge cases automatically.

## Great stuff, and the rest?

You will find it in the various files, hopefully as part of a discussion that makes sense. I suspect quite a few places may seem to contain non-sequitours, but that is a risk I am willing to accept in trying to adopt a conversational style.

My hope is that my words will inspire curiosity in you about the code and how it all fits together, your brain not knowing quite what to expect, which should hopefully help to promote wakefulness, at the very least.

I did my very best to hit all of the points of discussion specified in the original problem formulation. If I missed something, please let me know and I will gladly elaborate further.

## Is there any more cool trivia?

Yes! I ran the numbers myself on my own machine (which is significantly weaker than any server rig, or should I say container fleet, scaled to meet 20 million clients a day).

The deadline for the top100 function was being able to return a correct answer at any point in the program in under 300 milliseconds.

I ran it once for every request that trickled in, just to make things as hard as possible.

I also made each IP send multiple requests, 10 in the run pictured below:

![benchmark results](./benchmark.png)

As my results show, on my aging rig, the top100 function took 20 microseconds (mean) and 6 microseconds (median) accross 220 million requests from 20 million ips.

requestHandled, meanwhile, did a bit worse, taking all of 70 microseconds (mean) and 200 microseconds (median) to complete.

The good news are, even 200 microseconds is well within the range of 300 milliseconds.

## Is the code that runs intended as part of your submission?

Thank you for asking! No, it is in fact not intended as part of the challenge.

It's just there because I couldn't help myself but implement this project in a profile-guided manner.

And I expect you fine people to be as unabashedly nerdy as myself, and likely pretty curious to see how it runs anyways.

So I included that (just as trivia).

## And how would one go about running it? (Asking for a friend)

- Have Node.js, preferably the latest non-LTS version (17.9.0 as of this writing)
- Have the PNPM package manager installed (if you don't, run npm -g install pnpm)
- Run pnpm i && pnpm start
