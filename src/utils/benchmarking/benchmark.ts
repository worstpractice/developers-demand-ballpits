/**
 * ðŸŒˆ DISCLAIMER: ðŸŒˆ
 *
 * This is not the greatest code in the world. This is just a tribute. ðŸ˜…
 *
 * I humbly ask for this benchmarking function not to be treated as part of the exercise (and it really lies outside the scope of the task anyways).
 *
 * The reason I wish to include (despite it being pasta) is that it would've made me happy to recieve if I was a technical reviewer.
 *
 * Not because it's part of the challenge (it isn't), but because I'm an incurably curious skeptic.
 *
 * And so, I imagine I would be delighted to be given a way to conveniently run some inofficial numbers on my own machine, just to see.
 *
 * If this doesn't interest you, you're still great in my book, and you can skip this. âœŒ
 *
 * But if it does pique your interest to run this yourself â€” happy benchmarking!
 *
 * Just don't stay up late trying out all sorts of interesting performance tweaks ðŸ˜‰
